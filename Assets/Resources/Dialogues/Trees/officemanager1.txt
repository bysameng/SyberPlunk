We had to relocate you. Sorry.
<Again? Geez.>
	Don't give me that sass.
	<Why not?>
		Because I'm your superior. @ Just go pick up your COMPanion. @ It's on the desk. @ Run along now.
	</>
	<Well fuck you, Calyro.>
		Why don't you channel that rage. @ You have an assignment. @ It's on the desk. @ Run along now.
	</>
</>
<Oh.>
	Keep your chin up. It's really not that bad. @ I had to do it.
	<Bullshit you had to.>
		Look, we lost a chunk of our funding. @ Nothing I can do about it.
			<Well what about your goddamn office?>
				Hey man... @ You're barely ever in your office. @ I'm management. I practically live there.
					<*snort*>
						Well just goddamn do your job. @ It's on the desk.
					</>
			</>
			<Fine.>
				Alright, then we're clear. @ Go pick up your assignment on the table.
			</>
			<Another cut?>
				We're always losing money. @ We'd make more if you stopped wasting time. @ Go pick up your assignment.
			</>
	</>
	<Yeah, I know...>
		I'm glad you understand. @ Funding's been cut again. @ It's hard on all of us.
			<Anything I can do?>
				Well, you can help easily. @ Just do your job. @ Assignment's on the desk.
			</>
			<Well damn.>
				Well damn's right. @ InTRON's been sucking all of our cash. @ Whatever, fuck them. @ Go do your job. @ Your assignment's on the desk.
			</>
	</>
	<Ok. What's my next job?>
		I'm surprised you want to get to work. @ Good on you. @ Your assignment's on the desk.
	</>
</>
<Yeah, I kinda noticed.>
	Don't get wise with me. @ They cut into our funding. @ Massive rearrangements.
	<And you get rearranged into a larger office?>
		Look, you're barely ever in. @ I'm management, I basically live here.
			<Yeah ok.>
				Ok. @ Then go inside. @ There's a COMPanion on the desk. @ Do your job.
			</>
			<...>
				... @ Well, you have a new job. @ Your COMPanion's on the desk. @ Run along now.
			</>
	</>
	<Really? I didn't notice. /s>
		Because you're an idiot, clearly. @ We done talking here? @ Your assignment's on the desk inside.
	</>
	<I know, I know.>
		Alright, then we're clear.
		<No.>
			No, that wasn't a question. @ Your assignment's on the desk.
		</>
		<Yes.>
			Ok. @ Your assignment's on your desk. @ Run along now.
