<What happened here?>
	Plunking. @ Same old, same old.
	<Who did it?>
		That's what I'm trying to find out. @ I'm scanning the SCAfE now.

	<What is plunking?>
		What is plunking? @ Geez, man. @ You should know this. @ It uses this blue stick, a SCAfE. @ It kills people. @ I need to track this. @ Go talk to Grend.
