Hello, welcome back. @ Your new office is at the end of the hall to your right. @ Room 1409.
<I hate this new place.>
	It's alright. Me too. @ But don't whine to me!
	<I'll whine where I like.>
		Haha, I suppose so.
	</>
	<Why not?>
		Well, firstly it's not my fault. @ So there's that, haha! @ Well I mean you can blame me if you'd like. @ I'll blame you for this harsh blue lighting!
		<I like blue though>
			So it IS your fault! @ Hahaa
		</>
	</>
	<Ok, sorry.>
		Haha, no need to apologize. @ It's all good! @ Now get your behind to your office. @ I think Calyro's waiting for you.
	</>

<Are my things in there?>
	I am unsure. @ We only recently were moved here. @ Even I don't have my bearings yet.
	<Even you huh.>
		Yeah, even me. @ It's a little ridiculous how much they make us move around. @ I wonder why they do it.
		<It's because of all the Plunkers.>
			Yeah, maybe. @ We are in fact moving higher up each time.
			<Do you know anything about the Plunkers?>
				Not much. @ Maybe whatever I know from the news. @ And even if I did know a lot, @ I shouldn't be doing your job. @ Haha. @ Just kidding, man.
				<Not funny.>
					Ok, geez.
				</>
				<Hahaha.>
					Haha. @ Well anyways, I should probably go get... @ like a computer or something. @ Or at least some stimulants... @ This blue light's killing me.
					<See you.>
						Bye.
					</>
				</>
			</>
			<What do you know about STAfEs?>
				That that's what the SkyPlunkers use. @ Not much else, unfortunately. @ They do sound like quite a feat of science, though.
				<What do they do?>
					Well, all I know is that it somehow stores kinetic energy. @ It can then do something just as powerful as that. @ Kind of like a high tech, versatile pulley?
					<Sounds interesting.>
						Sure, I guess. @ Not really into the whole science-thing, though. @ Well anyways, I should go do my work. @ See you around.
					</>
					<Sounds dangerous.>
						Haha. @ Of course it is! @ I mean, if they weren't... @ Would SkyPlunkers use them to kill people?
						<Maybe for the difficulty.>
							True, but don't they do it because well... @ Jumping off of buildings is what they like.
						</>
						<They could.>
							Well of course you would want them to. @ If there were no murders, you'd be out of a job!
						</>
					</>
				</>
				<Indeed. I want one.>
					I hope you mean you want one for... @ Industrial purposes! @ And you want it for evidence, of course.
					<No, I want one to kill people with.>
						Hahaha. Good one.
					</>
					<Of course.>
						Haha. I gotcha.
					</>
