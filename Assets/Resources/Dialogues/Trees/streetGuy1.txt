Did you see what happened?
<Huh?>
	A guy got plunked.
	<Plunked?>
		Yeah, plunked. @ Kids these days stirring up trouble. @ They're taking industrial kinetic energy tools, @ jumping off of buildings, and "skyplunking" passerbys. @ It breaks their fall.
		<Where can I get one?>
			A STAfE? @ They're incredibly illegal now.
			<Makes me want it more.>
				What would you even use one for...
				<I'd lift things and put them down.>
					You're ridiculous.
				</>
				<I'd SkyPlunk.>
					I hope you're joking.
				</>
			</>
			<I thought they had legitimate uses.>
				...What would a regular person even do with one?
				<I dunno.>
					Nothing, that's what. @ Someone should do something about this.
				</>
				<SkyPlunk, obviously.>
					I hope you're joking.
				</>
			</>
		</>
		<Isn't that dangerous?>
			No fucking shit. @ Do you not goddamn see that guy? @ He's dead.
			<I meant for the "skyplunkers.">
				What? Who cares if they die! @ The better for us. @ I wouldn't have to fear being hit with gigatons of newtons or whatever.
				<I don't think it works that way...>
					Well I don't claim to know. @ All I know is that once they jump off that building, @ one person dies. @ It's either one of us or one of them. @ I'd rather it be one of them.
					<I agree.>
						I'm glad we're clear.
					</>
					<I disagree.>
						Well then you're probably just as bad as they are.
					</>
				</>
				<Sounds scary.>
					Of course it is! @ It's ridiculous! @ You could be walking off to work, then BAM! @ You're dead, jigawatts of newtons into your face.
					<Well, I guess you better watch out.>
						It wouldn't help given the speed they move at. @ But I will anyway.
					</>
					<It's probably not as bad as you think.>
						I can't believe that you'd say that. @ Do you not see the body in front of us? @ He's DEAD!
					</>
				</>
				<I was just joking.>
					Good.
				</>
			</>
		</>
		<Oh shit.>
		 	Yeah. @ It's pretty ridiculous. @ Someone should really do something about it.
		 	<I'm actually an INTForcer.>
		 		Yeah? @ Then it's your goddamn job. @ And you're asking me what plunking even is? @ Incompetence at its finest! @ Thanks for letting us die, noble INTForcer!
		 	</>
		 	<Someone should.>
		 		But nobody will. @ This city just gets better and better, huh.
		 	</>
		</>
	</>
</>
<No.>
	Well, this fellow here just got plunked.
	<Plunked?>
		Yeah. @ People... well, scum, @ have been "plunking." @ That is, they jump from high places with a STAfE. @ They use that STAfE to break their fall, on a poor passerby.
		<STAfE?>
			Yeah. @ They're like these rod like objects... @ Oh, you can see that the scum left it. @ It's on the poor soul's dead body. @ Nonfunctional now, of course.
			<Any other info?>
				What is this, an interrogation? @ I just was walking and a guy was fucking plunked. @ I was almost within 5 meters of him. @ I could be dead right now.
				<Didn't mean it like that.>
					It's fine.
				</>
				<Don't worry so much.>
					How can you tell me not to worry? @ I could be randomly plunked any second of any day. @ What do you expect me to stay inside all day?
					<It wouldn't hurt...>
						I vend at the street market. @ I need to be outside to survive... @ It was a rhetorical question.
					</>
					<Ok, sorry.>
						It's fine.
					</>
				</>
			</>
			<Thanks.>
				No problem.
			</>
		</>
	</>
	<Shit.>
		Yeah... a real shame. @ It scares me.
	</>
</>
<Yes.>
	A damn shame, isn't it? @ Guy got plunked just minutes ago here.
	<Plunked?>
		Yeah, you know. @ It's the new "it thing." @ Adolescents have been dropping down from skyscrapers, @ breaking their falls with STAfEs. @ By using them on passerbys, of course.
		<STAfEs?>
			You're clueless, aren't you? @ STAfEs were that thing all over the news? @ It redirects kinetic energy or something. @ I don't know the specifics. @ It was originally for heavy lifting at warehouses. @ But now all these goddamn punks have them.
			<Where can I get one?>
				Are you seriously asking? @ It's a huge felony to even look at one now. @ In other words, no, I don't know.
			</>
			<Any ideas where they're getting them?>
				What the fuck? @ Are you goddamn accusing me of something?
				<Yes.>
					Well I don't fucking have one.
						<Sounds pretty suspicious...>
							Well you can search me if you so damn please. @ I'm obviously wearing lots of clothes. @ Just get away from me, you shithead.
						</>
						<I'm an INTForcer.>
							Oh right, and I'm the Queen of INFoC. @ You're such a goddamn noap. @ Go away.
						</>
				</>
				<No.>
					Well then you better watch your fucking tongue. @ Go away, you fucking noap.
				</>
			</>
		</>
	</>
	<Yeah what a shame.>
		He never asked for this...
