It's beautiful, isn't it?
Touching it would kill you.
That's why they put the glass there.
None of us can jump, you see.
It's alright though.
You wouldn't want to die like this.
Hmmm...
You know, barely anyone comes here.
You're the first one I've seen in a while.
Most people would just look at pictures online.
Kind of silly, if you ask me.
You've gotta be here to appreciate its beauty.
I'm glad you relate. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
I love The Stream.
It's so beautiful.
I've only seen one other guy here ever before.
He just came in one day, around this time.
Then he sat down, crosslegged, near the middle.
He just sat there and cried.
Then after a while, he left.
I don't think he noticed me, as I was near the wall.
Crazy, right?
Anyways, thanks for talking with me.
It gets lonely here sometimes.
But I just wanna stare into The Stream for a while.
If you don't mind, thanks.
Please. We can talk later.
I just want to stare into The Stream for a while.
Please, give me a moment here.
Really. Stop bothering me for a while.
Leave me alone for a bit.
Stop talking to me. Go do something else.
Leave me in peace with The Stream.
Really, please. Stop talking to me.
@The majesty of The Stream!
It is so beautiful.
I love The Stream.
It is perfect in every way.
Don't you just love the way it connects with you?
It understands you like nobody else.
I love coming here and just staring into it.
The Stream is wonderful.
Don't you agree?
Most people don't.
Most people just look at pictures online.
You can't get the full effect through a picture.
...
So beautiful...

Hey, thanks for talking with me.
It gets lonely here sometimes.
You know, the last time I saw someone in here...
He was a crazy one.
He stood in the middle, and stared into The Stream.
Then he broke out into tears and left.
He didn't notice me, as I was near the wall.
Hahahah...
Anyways, I wanna just stare into it for a while.
If you don't mind, thanks.
Please, we can talk later.
I just want to stare for a while.
Please. I'll talk to you later.
Let me stare in silence for a bit.
@I love The Stream.
Don't you?
I love the way it twinkles.
I love the way it rumbles.
I love the way it makes me feel.
It numbs all pains.
It gives all happinesses.
It caresses my mind.
I love The Stream.
I wish others would appreciate it.
Last time I saw someone in here?
I think it was four months ago.
Around this time, actually, I think...
He came in one day, and sat down near the middle.
He sat there, staring into The Stream, crying.
After a while, he walked around for a bit and left.
He didn't notice me, I think, since I was near the wall.
It looked like he was crazy.
Weird, huh?
Well anyways...
I just wanna stare into The Stream for a while.
If you don't mind, thanks.
Please, we can talk later.
I just want to stare for a while.
Please. I'll talk to you later.
Let me stare in silence for a bit.
