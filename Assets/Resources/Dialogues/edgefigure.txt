Oh don't sneak up on me like that.
You could've scared me off of the edge.
Do you want that?
I'm just taking a break here.
Nothing else.
Nothing more.
Don't worry about it.
Why don't you run along now?
@I'm just taking a break here.
Calm down, I'm not going to jump.
If that was what you were thinking.
I like looking at the city here.
It's nice huh?
I like this spot.
Yeah.
Well, I just wanna be alone here...
If you don't mind...
You can find your own spot.
There should be some free spots...
Like, everywhere else in the world.
Go, run along now.
Go find your own spot.
@Oh whoa there.
No, I'm not going to jump.
If that's what you were thinking.
I just come here to look at the Towers.
It's beautiful.
I love it at this time of day.
But...
It's much better alone.
Trust me.
You can find your own spot.
Find out for yourself, alright?
Alright.
Run along now.
@*It isn't reeaaaal but it feeels reeaaaal*
Oh. Haha.
I wasn't singing.
I was just practicing...
...for a play.
Yeah.
...
I'm an actor.
Or at least, used to be.
...
Nevermind.
Ok, I just like watching the Towers here.
Alone, that is.
You can try it out for yourself.
Alone, of course.
So run along now, scram.
