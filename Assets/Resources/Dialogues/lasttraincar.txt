You found me.
What are you doing back here?
This is my spot.
Why are you talking to me?
You can't even answer.
You are mute.
What did you think you'd find back here?
Something?
Well, you did.
So there you go.
Are you glad?
I hope you're glad.
Well, there's nothing else back here.
Maybe if you came back next time.
Not right now.
...
I don't want to talk anymore.
@You found me.
How did you even manage to?
Did you have a hunch?
Did somebody tell you?
Who was it?
Oh, right.
You can't talk.
Even though it says "TALK."
I'm the one talking.
You're just reading the floating box.
Am I even speaking?
Does anyone even speak?
...
I don't know.
I don't want to know.
...
I don't want to talk anymore.
@Well, you found me.
I was hiding back here.
I've been here the entire time.
Rarely anybody goes to the end cars.
I like looking out of the front.
It is nice.
I remember once I looked out the front.
I saw some smoke off in the distance.
...
Well, that was another life.
I don't want to talk anymore.
@You found me.
Rarely anyone is ever in the end cars.
I used to hate them too.
Now I live here.
It's nice here.
I can just look out the window.
And sit in the two-person seats.
It is my favorite part of the train car.
I wish they made one-person seats.
I'm not large enough.
If I were large enough, it would be fine.
...
Well, nevermind.
I don't want to talk anymore.
