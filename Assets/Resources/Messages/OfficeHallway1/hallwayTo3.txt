It seems like I can't goddamn sit down in the office before they give me a newer, shittier one.
I can't even sit down in an office without them giving me a newer, shittier one.
Would it kill them to just stop changing my office so fucking often?
It feels like I can't even move my shit in without them telling me I'm moving again.
